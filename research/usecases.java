========================================================
make kathryn happy:
    * support right click copy and right click paste (both inside and outside Sheets)
    * does she need to modify stuff in sheets without a paste? [probably yes :/]
ask kathryn if she cares about these:
    cmd+v and cmd+shift+v differentiation https://github.com/bubakazouba/autoauto/issues/69
    multiple sheets in 1 spreadsheet https://github.com/bubakazouba/autoauto/issues/68
questions to kathryn:
    do u only do copies and pastes in the spreadsheet?
        do you ever manually modify stuff there?
    mac or windows?
    what browser?
